## 🧠 About Me

I'm an innovative AI engineer passionate about building practical, efficient, and scalable AI/ML solutions.  
From smart trolleys in retail to real-time sentiment monitoring systems, I love working on projects that make an impact.

I specialize in:
- Natural Language Processing (BERT, GPT, Transformers)
- Computer Vision (YOLOv5, Image Classification, Segmentation)
- Scalable deployment using FastAPI, Docker, and AWS

I'm currently pursuing **B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning** and actively working on real-world projects & internships.
